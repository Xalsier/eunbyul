            <p>
              Story-based perk with a passive +1 to Intelligence. Each time Eun-byul internalizes a thought (focus), she will have to roll a 2d6 which will determine what sensory intrusion/controlled delusion she experiences. None of the sensory intrusions will be visual, nor will they make her freeze up.

        <h2>Backstory</h2>
        <p>Her father, Richard Selous- made a great deal of teaching Eun-byul how to read at an early age. She learned a lot about her ancestor, Frederick Selous, who was a colonizer- and she developed somewhat positive feelings about that side of her history. As for her mother, she taught Eun how to speak and write Korean, and as such a lot of her Eun-byuls Journals are written in only Korean. Eun-byuls grandparents on her mothers side also had a predisposition to Alzheimers- and as such her mother was quite protective over her and encouraged her to write to preserve her memorys.</p><br><br>
        <p>When she was 9, she went to Onondaga Lake to go fishing with her older brother Mike. At the cookout- she ate multiple before her mother arrived and revealed that the fish had been contaminated with Mercury. Following up the years after that, she first took DMSA tablets as prescribed after that to remove the mercury- but for some reason there still remained a significant amount in her as if she was having prolonged exposure to it from something else in her environment.<br><br></p>
        <p>After that, came anti-psychotic medicine as she was facing trouble with hearing voices in her head at an early age. Her father used to joke that it was because of the mercury and didn't find it to be too serious, but her mother would always take her to the doctor. As it turned out, Eun-byul wasn't taking the medicine- because she found the delusions to be helpful in memorization. Instead, she had developed coping strategys. Whenever she played d&d, she'd let these 'voices' out to embody the characters.</p><br><br>
        <p>Her true voice was only accessible when she wrote in her journal, whenever she thought- it would always be a conversation with the other ones in her head. Her brother joined the navy at some point when she was in middle school. She joined the misfits at some point in high school- which encouraged her chaotic antics, and used her intelligence to come up with pranks to get inspiration for her personal writing and ideas for things to do in d&d campaigns.</p>
